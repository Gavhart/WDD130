                        Think about the last time you were using an app to navigate a trail. Did you loose service? 
            Or wish you printed off those directions? 
            I do that! I make mobile applications that track locations and trails and how to get to them. Here you can log in and add your favorite trails. 
            You can also add your favorite trails to your profile, then you can share them with your friends and family and they can add them to their profile.
            Here at Avid Biker we want to make sure you have the best experience possible on your next ride and we want to make sure you don't get lost on your favorite trail.

                    <h3>Welcome to Avid Biker, have you ever riden a trail with a friend and wish you could save that trail for later? 

                        My name is Gavin Hart and I am a avid mountain biker. I have been riding for 10 years and have ridden all over the world.
                        I like many other mountain bikers have a favorite trail. I have ridden the same trail over and over again and I have always wished I could save that trail for later.
                        Sometimes the trail I find dosnt have a name or a location. I have created this website to help other mountain bikers not get lost and to save their favorite trails.
                        I have created a mobile application that will help you save your favorite trails and share them with your friends and family.
                        I have also created a website that will help you save your favorite trails and share them with your friends and family.
                        More updates to come soon.
