                            This style of riding is a combination of cross-country and downhill. typically the bikes being used are 150-200mm travel bikes.
                            This is the style of riding that I do the most of. I love the challenge of the climbs and the thrill of the descents.

                            This style of riding usually involves a lot of climbing and descending. Usually cross country riders will be riding on single track trails that are not too technical.
                            usually the trails are not too steep and are not too rocky.

                        This is a style of mountain biking that involves riding down steep, rocky, and technical terrain. usually 
                        with the intention of reaching the bottom as quickly as possible. Sometimes, downhill mountain biking is 
                        also referred to as "downhill racing" or "downhill freeriding".

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Is based upon the same concept as a mountain bike, but with a rigid rear fork. Though not having as much travel as
                        a full suspension bike, hardtails are still capable of handling most terrain. They are also lighter and more efficient.
