    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->

    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      The best Whitewater Rafting on the Grand Canyon, Wild River Rafting Company
      offers rafting on the Grand Canyon and Roaring Fork Rivers in Arizona
      Springs. Since 1969, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
      Grand Canyon and beyond.
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      This 88-mile section of the Colorado River is an excellent introduction to 
      the Grand Canyon as the rapids progress from moderate to extra large and the 
      cliffs and rock layers rise higher and higher. We see some of the most striking 
      and vibrantly colored limestone cliffs as we pass Marble Canyon. Our Grand Canyon
       adventure includes visits to Native American ruins, the fern-fringed spring of
      Vasey’s Paradise, the cool recess of Redwall Cavern, ancient fossils and a swim 
      in the turquoise blue Little Colorado. At the end of the week of floating, 
      hiking and camping in the Grand Canyon’s majesty, this trip concludes with a 
      dramatic long hike up to the South Rim.
